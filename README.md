# Washing-Machine-Controller

The .vhd file contains the VHDL code for a washing machine that runs through 5 states - soak, wash, rinse, spin & dry.

It takes inputs as a coin to start the machine and an add_rinse function to include an additional rinse in the cycle.

If the lid is ever open the machine stops its functioning, and resumes when the lid is closed.
